# Proto-adapter CoOp Hybrid
This is a project that utilizes a proto-adapter and CoOp to do few-shot learning on the Flowers102 dataset (For now, later it will be tested on other datasets). This was originally built for a project in a deep learning course with myself, and Christian Li Sivertsen.

The ipynb file is the project that was turned in, and under the modular folder is where I am converting it into a modular implementation (This is not complete yet).
